# Foreword

First, thanks for making the time for this challenge! We really appreciate it.

## Challenge - Dog Team

### What should you build?

Design a small React app that shows a list of breeds using the api "Dog API" (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). Add the ability to search the list by breed name. When a breed on the list is clicked, the app should navigate to the breed page.

The breed page: this page should show a list of dog pictures of the breed. This list should have a traditional pager or a scrolling pager, you decide. Add a button "Add to my team" to each dog.

When "add to my team" button is clicked, the dog should be added to the user's team. The user's team can have a maximum of 10 dogs and cannot have more than 3 dogs of the same breed.

My team section: this section should display the user's team. The dogs should be grouped by breed in the UI. Add a button to remove a dog from the user's team.

For saving the data of "My team section" use something local, may be cookies, local storage or something else. But don't use anything on the server side.

### Notes

- Add a README with everything you consider necessary to run the app
- Do not develop any backend code
- If you make any assumptions, take note of them in the README, so we can better understand your decisions.
- We are open for questions if you have any doubts
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
